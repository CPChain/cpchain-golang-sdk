	// of topics. Topics matches a prefix of that list. An empty element slice matches any
	// topic. Non-empty elements represent an alternative that matches any of the
	// contained topics.

	// Examples:
	// {} or nil          matches any topic list
	// {{A}}              matches topic A in first position
	// {{}, {B}}          matches any topic in first position, B in second position
	// {{A}, {B}}         matches topic A in first position, B in second position
	// {{A, B}}, {C, D}}  matches topic (A OR B) in first position, (C OR D) in second position
